# trx-rs (work in progress)

This is an early, untested snapshot of a transceiver control stack (core + backend + HTTP frontend). Things may change quickly and APIs are not stable yet. Expect rough edges and bugs; use at your own risk and please report issues you hit. Features, tests and docs are still being written (or not).

## Supported backends

- Yaesu FT-817 (feature-gated crate `trx-backend-ft817`)
- Planned: other rigs I own; contributions and reports are welcome.
